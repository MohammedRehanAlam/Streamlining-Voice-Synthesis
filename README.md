## Voice Synthesis with RVC Model

### Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of a voice synthesis model using the RVC (Retrieval-Based Voice Conversion) architecture. The model is trained to generate speech that sounds like the user's voice. This repository contains all the necessary files and instructions to replicate the results on your local machine.

### Features
- Generate synthetic speech in your voice.
- Fine-tune the model with your own voice data.
- Easy to use and modify for custom applications.
